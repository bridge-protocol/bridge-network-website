The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Wake County, North Carolina.

If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="corrections">Corrections<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#corrections" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>There may be information on the Bridge Digital Identity Platform that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information.
